# Roll-Call-Video-Game


Project aim: this project aims to create a fun and interactive roll call for teachers to implement into their morning routines in the classroom. It intends to introduce younger students to a simple idea of coding and video game play and development. 
Project platform of choice: The platform I decided to use for this prototype is Microsoft's Makecode Arcade. This platform enabled me to create a simplified and creative video game for students and teachers.
Primary Objectives: The primary objectives of creating this video game prototype are to create a fun, interactive roll call activity that teachers can use and cater to their educational needs to their required demographic.
Secondary Objectives: Students are required to hover their sprite over the correct answer that correlates to their asked question.
